Goal: Developing a SNR tool for use in cetacean research

## Introduction
This tool is for use in calculating the signal to noise (SNR) for cetacean vocalizations. 

## Set up
### Initial Start Up
1) Either clone or download the .zip and unzip the SNR_Tool_Development repository to your local machine.
2) Add this new directory with all its subfolders to your MATLAB path.
### Requirements
The tool requires a few inputs to calculate the SNR values.
  -  SNR_PARAMS.csv: a parameter file which contains the filtering and noise presets for each specie's call type. This file has values for:
      - Species - The species of interest (e.g. Blue Whale)
      - Call Type - The call type (e.g. Tonal) 
      - Lower Frequency - Lower bound of the bandpass filter (Hz)
      - Upper Frequency - Upper bound of the bandpass filter (Hz)
      - Noise Distance - Value to determine how far before the **signal** the **noise** sample will be taken
      - BP_Buffer - Value to add a buffer to the bandpass filter to minimize edge effects
      - Units - Definition of the units used in Noise Distance and BP_Buffer (seconds or samples)
- A directory containing the .csv annotations output generated by JASCO's PAMLAB. These files contain the annotation output of the manually selected calls. The inputs used from these files are:
  - Filename - used to identify the original .wav file containing the call
  - Relative Start Time - The manually selected start time in seconds of the call annotation relative to the start of the .wav file
  - StartTime90 - The start in seconds from the Relative Start Time of the span of time which contains 90% of the energy within the annotation.
  - StopTime90 -  The end in seconds from the Relative Start Time of the span of time which contains 90% of the energy within the annotation.
- A directory containing all the .wav files for which PAMLAB annotation .csv files exist. *Note: This directory can contain additional .wav files, but **must** contain all .wav files for which PAMLAB annotations exist*   

## Working outline for SNR functions

### function "snr.extractSN"
```matlab
[xSignal, xNoise] = snr.extractSN(x, fs, sigStart, sigStop, noiseDist, units)
```
**Inputs**
- x = data vector
- fs = sampling rate
- sigStart = signal start time or sample
- sigStop = signal stop time or sample
- noiseDist = distance from signal from which to sample noise, in time or samples
- units = string specifying if start, stop, and distance inputs represent time or samples

**Outputs**
- xSignal = 
- xNoise = 

### function "snr.calculateSNR"
```matlab
[snrVal] = calculateSNR(xSignal, xNoise)
```
**Inputs**
- xSignal = signal samples
- xNoise = noise samples

**Outputs**
- snrVal = Signal to Noise Ratio value
